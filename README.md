This Repo contains the backend of Food Order Application.
It is written in Express JS and Node JS. 
Node JS provides a server side platform which is impossible with raw JS.
Express JS provides routing and all the routing level functions like the middleware function execution easy which wouldn't have been possible only with Node JS.
I have used mongoose which works as ODM(Object Document Modeliing).
I have used different functionalities of ODM like Document Middleware, Instance Methods, Static Methods.
I have used MONGO DB for storing backend informations.
